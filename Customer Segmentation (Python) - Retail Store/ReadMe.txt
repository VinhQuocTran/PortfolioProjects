In this project, I apply my knowledge of Python programming skills to guide you through typical stages of customer segmentation tasks.

Some skills that I used for this project
1. Data Preprocessing (Data Cleaning, Manipulation, Wrangling)
2. Data Visualization (Histogram, bar chart, pie chart, box plot, swarmplot)
3. Feature Engineering and Standardization
4. Machine Learning (K-Mean algorithm) for Customer Segmentation
5. Model Evaluation and Visualization

I highly recommend that you download CustomerSegmentation.html and open it in a browser for easy viewing, it already includes table of content
If you want to read directly or modify and run step by step, just click or download CustomerSegmentation.ipynb and you are good to go
