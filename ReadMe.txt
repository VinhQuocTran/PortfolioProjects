This repository contains all of my projects for Data Analyst Job. It is a showcase and also a remainder to myself that how much I've learnt and improved since I first joined Data Science areas.
Even though I put a lot of effort into the projects to make them look polished, I can't guarantee with you that they are perfect and bug-free. But it shows that I'm always willing to learn new knowledge and keep moving forward. So if you have anything to teach me or any intern opportunity, feel free to reach me.

Some Excel skills that I acquired and used for the project
1. Power Query and Power Pivot (I never realized that how easy and powerful they are for data cleaning and transforming)
2. Data model and pivot table
3. Dynamic named ranged and data source for chart
4. How to build clean, interactive Dashboard that has filters for reporting and visualizing
