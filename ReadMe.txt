This repository contains all of my projects for Data Analyst Job. It is a showcase and also a remainder to myself that how much I've learnt and improved since I first joined Data Science areas.

Even though I put a lot of effort into the projects to make them look polished, I can't guarantee with you that they are perfect and bug-free. But it shows that I'm always willing to learn new knowledge and keep moving forward. So if you have any question or intern opportunity, feel free to reach me.
