## Problem ##
If you are learning Data Science, you might encounter this problem as I do at some point. You have acquired your skills to become data analyst/scientist/engineer, you feel excited and ready to apply your knowledge into a real-world project. You search for a dataset that fit your idea but you can't find it, even if you've gone to every online public platform like Kaggle, data-worldbank,... .
The truth hurts but then you have to accept and realize that if you want to find a unique dataset for your project, you can't rely entirely on public platforms. No need to worry about, I will show you how I scrape my own dataset using Scrapy library in this project.




















This project has 2 parts: Data Preprocessing in Python and Excel Dashboard. If you are interested in how I transformed and cleaned the dataset for the project, you can open DataPreprocessing.ipynb in Part 1 folder. Otherwise, just open the excel file in Part 2 folder and check out the amazing-interactive dashboard that I made for company sales.


Some Excel skills that I acquired and used after finished the project
1. Power Query and Power Pivot (I never realized that how easy and powerful they are for data cleaning and transforming)
2. Data model and pivot table
3. Dynamic named ranged and data source for chart
4. How to build clean, interactive Dashboard that has filters for reporting and visualizing
